Analysis of Differential Ion Channel Gene Expression in the Endometrium of Women Experiencing Recurrent Implantation Failures

Data Collection of Microarray Datasets:
This study systematically aggregated microarray datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's public repository (available at NCBI GEO: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Specifically, it incorporated four datasets pertinent to Recurrent Implantation Failure (RIF): GSE205398 and GSE188409, focusing on protein-coding, and GSE121219, emphasizing miRNA coding. Dataset GSE121219 encompasses endometrial samples from five RIF patients and five fertile controls during the Window of Implantation (LH+7), while GSE205398 and GSE205398 include samples from six and eight RIF patients, respectively, alongside a comparable number of fertile controls, collected during the mid-secretory phase.
Microarray Differential Gene Expression Analysis:
The study merged the three expression matrices, ensuring alignment on common genes, and addressed batch effects using the "removeBatchEffect" function from the R Bioconductor package "limma" (version 3.52.4). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to discern inter- and intra-group variances between RIF and control groups. The differential expression of genes was determined via the "limma" package, adhering to a statistical significance threshold of |log2FC| > 1.5 and an adjusted p-value < 0.05. Visualization tools, including volcano plots and heatmaps, were utilized, with an emphasis on the 15 genes showing the most significant differential expression.
DNA Methylation (DNAm) Data Analysis:
For the examination of DNA methylation patterns in endometriosis, the study utilized dataset GSE188409, which consists of 30 endometriosis cases and 30 controls. This dataset employs the GPL21145 (Infinium MethylationEPIC) platform. Post quality control (QC), PCA was conducted on the M-values from the DNAm dataset, generating PCA plots to investigate batch effects and differential clustering based on covariates like sample processing batch, genetic ancestry, cycle phase, endometriosis status, site, and plate. The Principal Component Partial R-Square (PC-PR2) method estimated the influence of these covariates on sample variability. Additionally, correlation analyses were performed between covariates and principal components. The SVA algorithm, via the R package SmartSVA [54], was employed for batch effect mitigation, focusing on endometriosis status and menstrual cycle phase.
Single Site Analysis of DNAm Data:
The study probed the association of DNAm at individual sites with endometriosis status and menstrual cycle phase using a linear model from the Limma R package. The model was defined as: DNAm values ~ endometriosis status + Cycle phase + SVs, with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value of 0.05 as the significance threshold. Data visualization was achieved using the Complex Heatmap108 package in R. Further, a mixed linear model (MLM) approach was utilized for robustness in associating endometriosis and cycle phase differences.
